Currently work at the DLR Institute of Systems Engineering for Future Mobility in Oldenburg, Germany. Research focus is mainly on developing techniques that would verify safety of AI-based Automated Driving Functions being used in cars.

Big fan of sports of varied types. Current favourites include football (the European kind ;), basketball and table tennis.
